    <h4>User Account</h4>
    <p>
      You must register as a member on the Website in order to shop, to use some
      services and to enjoy special promotions and activities. For safety and
      security, each customer is allowed to create only one registered account
      by default. For customers who attempt to create several accounts, We
      reserve the right to suspend accounts without further notice. In
      accordance with Customs regulations customers must provide valid and
      accurate data. All consignee names, address and payers name should be
      valid. In certain countries the consignee may have to submit their ID or
      passport to clear the package or for payment verification purpose.
      Customers are solely responsible for the accuracy of data that they
      provide on the Website. Should any information be incorrect and prevent
      any shipment or deliveries or customs clearance, Miini will not be held
      responsible and will not offer any compensation in such cases. Miini will
      always comply with the law, and We kindly remind users to do the same. As
      importers the customers are responsible to comply with all laws and
      regulations in their own countries.
    </p>
    <h4>Ordering</h4>
    <p>
      Whilst all efforts are made to ensure accuracy of product descriptions,
      specifications and pricing there may be occasions where errors arise.
      Should such a situation occur Miini will not accept your order. In the
      event of a mistake you will be contacted with a full explanation and a
      corrected offer. Likewise customers cannot benefit from any bugs or
      mistakes affecting the website. Any such benefits will be considered
      unjust and customers will be obliged to immediately waive them. The
      information displayed is considered as an invitation not as a confirmed
      offer for sale. The contract is confirmed upon supply of goods. Given the
      popularity and/or supply constraints of some of the products offered on
      the Website, Miini may have to limit the number of products available for
      purchase. Miini reserves the right to change quantities available for
      purchase at any time, even after you place an order. Following order
      dispatch, transportation is the sole responsibility of third-party
      logistics company. During this stage, full ownership of the product(s)
      belongs to the buyer; therefore all associated liability and risks during
      transportation shall be borne by the buyer.

      package, our Warranty and Return policy comes into effect.
    </p>
    <h4>Shipping and Delivery</h4>
    <p>
      Shipping times displayed on the Website refer to the estimated dispatch
      time of the packages. Since the actual delivery of your order can be
      impacted by many events beyond Miini's control We suggest that if
      customers have a special occasion or event that they wish to use their
      item for, such as a birthday, that they order their items well in advance.
      Miini cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work
      with you to ensure a smooth shopping experience. For a smooth delivery and
      peace of mind, We strongly recommend that customers purchase shipping
      guarantee during the checkout. In the event that your package has a

      intimidating language; personal and verbal abuse; sexist, racist,
      homophobic, or derogatory remarks; rudeness; inflammatory statements;
      swearing; and unsubstantiated allegations. Persistently making habitually
      demanding or vexatious complaints, despite the matter having been fully
      addressed; similarly, repeating complaints persisting despite reasonable
      and fair solutions being offered in accordance with our policies. Asking,
      expecting or demanding staff to breach established company policy
      guidelines, e.g. refund amount, time lines, special compensation, etc.;
      similarly, seeking an unrealistic outcome beyond the scope of our own
      policies and procedures. Repeatedly changing the nature (or focus) of a
      complaint or the desired outcome, part way, after a formal response has
      been provided. Excessive number of complaints compared to the total

      formally notified of the following: Their language is considered
      offensive, abusive, threatening, and wholly unacceptable. They must
